It will be using the Jekyll theme provided by Github and will host details about my projects and other repositories.

# Other website
You can head to [here](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~cs1150263/) for my another website hosted in IIT Delhi servers.

# Credits
I have used [this](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) repo for the particles hovering.
