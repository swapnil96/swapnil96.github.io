<p>Hi, my name is Swapnil Das. I have graduated from IIT Delhi in 2019 with a 
B.Tech degree in Computer Science & Engineering. I hail from Assam which is a
very beautiful place amidst the craziness of India.</p>

<p>During college years I tried many things ranging from Inter hostel cultural
competitions to sports competitions to tech hackathons to just wasting time binge
watching some TV series or movies.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working full time as a analyst in Alphagrep Securities. My work
is related to developing low latency C++ code required for High Frequency Trading.
I have worked in NSE/BSE market data side and now I am looking into China markets.
To dive more deeply into the work, I can categorize it as working either into the
market data side (i.e getting market data from exchanges/broker) or working into
the order sending side.</p>
