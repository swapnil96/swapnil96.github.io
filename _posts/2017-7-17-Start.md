## Start of my blog using Jekyll and Github.io pages#

There is a [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for building your 1st blog using Jekyll and pushing it live through github.io pages. 

I will be updating details about the projects I did and I am interested in.
