## Why a website 

This website can be a way to get share some interesting topics/info about
tech, astronomy etc. As time goes on I will try to develop it and make it
more useful for general audience too.

### The other blog post

There are 2-3 redundant blog post at the bottom. I just kept it there so
that in future it will be easier to get the markdown formatting options
quickly.
